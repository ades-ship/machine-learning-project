MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM MOVIE DATABASE DATASET
Here I just demostrate how Content Based Movie Recommender Engine Works .
Content based movie recommender uses cosine similarity algorithm and content based filtering algorithm to find similarity and metrics distance of all movies.

APPLICATION :
# 1.As we know we all like to watch the movie in spare time and everbody like movie so this is just recommendation to all those users who likes content based movies.
### 2.Literally recommendation engines are throughly used in all domains like in e-commerce platform,in youtube,even in daily life routine like what to eat,wears,cosmatic materials etc.
3. These all areas really provoke to me to make movie Recommender system.
